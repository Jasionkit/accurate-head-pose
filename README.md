# accurate-head-pose

We release the code of the [Hybrid Coarse-fine Classification for Head Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.06778), built on top of the [deep-head-pose](https://github.com/natanielruiz/deep-head-pose).


### Acknowledgement
Our hybrid classification network is plug-and-play on top of the [deep-head-pose](https://github.com/natanielruiz/deep-head-pose), but it could be extended to other classification tasks easily. We thank Nataniel Ruiz for releasing deep-head-pose-Pytorch codebase.
